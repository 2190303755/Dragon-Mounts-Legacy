Github Repostory for the Dragon Mounts: Legacy Minecraft Mod.

### About
___

Dragon Mounts was a mod originally created by BarracudaATA, in an attempt to make the previously useless dragon eggs
hatchable and implements tameable Ender Dragon-esque creatures. Albeit smaller and weaker, they provide wider ranges
of utility, and even adapt to their environments!

Dragon Mounts: Legacy is the continuation of this magic in the modern minecraft version. By implementing minor updates
and expanding on the mechanics, the aim is to upgrade the quality, while maintaining the LEGACY feel.

DM:L features a completely re-done codebase with bits and pieces of the original code here and there.
Features such as the habitat mechanics and riding have been completely rethought and redesigned, while the model and
animations have been kept to their original code (mostly) and thus quality.

### Customization
___
**Contributors and Modpack Devs Alike**

DM:L was designed with customization in mind. Dragon Breeds can be fully customizable through the use of json files.
An entirely new breed can be made with a combo of a datapack and resourcepack. *No Code Necessary!* Of course, like
datapack nature, existing breeds can be edited as well. More info and how to do it is described on the wiki.
